# Schedular
Developted for Operating System Principles at RMIT. Program simulates an os' process/task schedular.

To compile and run:

Use makefile:
#make

Pass the schedular type as an argument:
#./main FCFS
#./main SJF
#./main RR

The program will output data in format
<process id>, <waiting time>, <turnaround time>

This is a csv friendly format so the output may be routed into a csv file for data analysis.
For Example:
#./main FCFS >> outputFCFS.csv
